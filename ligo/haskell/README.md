# BaseDAO LIGO - Haskell library

This includes functionality for LIGO contract that cannot be expressed in LIGO itself.

In particular, this directory contains:
- an [Haskell library](./src), containing Haskell binding for the contract
- a [Utility Executable](./app), mainly useful to produce metadata
- the [contract tests](./test), based on the library
